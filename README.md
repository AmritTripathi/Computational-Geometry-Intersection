# Computational-Geometry-Intersection
This project is a comprehensive tool for detecting intersections between various geometric shapes, including lines, circles, and polygons. It demonstrates fundamental and advanced concepts of computational geometry and intersection detection algorithms, focusing on:

Line-Line Intersections using orientation-based checks and edge cases handling.
Circle-Circle Intersections leveraging Euclidean distance calculations.
Line-Circle Intersections with distance-to-line formulas.
Polygon-Polygon Intersections by checking all edges for potential intersections.
The project emphasizes precision, edge case handling, and efficient geometric computations without using spatial data structures (like KD-Trees) in the initial phase. Future iterations may incorporate optimization techniques and spatial partitioning algorithms to handle complex shapes more efficiently.

Tech Stack:

C++: Core programming language.
Algorithms: Orientation checks, bounding box exclusion, and collinearity checks for intersections.
This project serves as a learning and showcase tool for mastering computational geometry concepts, algorithm optimization, and efficient shape intersection handling.
